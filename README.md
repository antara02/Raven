# Raven

Name of the Project : RAVEN (A standard VTOL)

Problem : To make a light weight standard (4+1) VTOL which can be used during natural disasters to provide immediate medical relief.

Problem solution :
In order to tackle with this problem we divided our team in three major groups : Aerodynamics , Avoinics , Design.
Aerodynamics : Selected a airfoil from airfoil database. While selecting airfoil we keep in mind our major requirements such as maximum flight time with sufficient lift. For analysis of Airfoil we used XLR5 software.

Calibration Part : It can be done via Mission Planner, although by default it doesnâ€™t have any firmware for VTOL but with some fine optimization within fixed wing plane firmware it can be achieved.
Alternatively, it can also be done with the help of Qground controller software which by default has firmware for VTOL 

Airspeed Sensor : As we are going to use for public welfare so in order to avoid any mishap we would be using Airspeed sensor so that the transition from quadcopter to fixed wing occur with proper stability and accuracy.

Load : Our payload will be of course a medical supply related stuff so this would be our payload and in order to deliver medical supply to consumer we would we using single trap door mechanism keeping in mind to keep VTOL weight light as well as in this we only need two serovs instead of four servos (if we double trap door mechanism) so it will also cost and space effective.

Design : 
(1). We are making H frame configuration instead of X frame configuration (reason pta ho toh mention kr dena) so in order to make this frame to mount propellers we would be using PLA instead of Aluminium rods to make VTOL light weight.
(2). To make out VTOL as aerodynamic as possible we are using fuselage whose cross-section will be shape of a irregular octagon instead of using cylindrical fuselage as due to resources limitations as well as other issues.
(3). H frame rods will be attached through the wing like RMRC Anaconda and we would we using same kind of mechanism for attachment as done in RMRC Anaconda.

Data insights :
(1). Can include dimensions of so formed fuselage, wing span, root chord length
(2). Flight Controller : Pishawk 4
Motor :
Battery : 4 cell LiPo battery (not sure)
